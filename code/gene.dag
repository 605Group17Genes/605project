# This "gene.dag" script is a Directed Acyclic Graph Manager (DAGMan)
# meta-scheduler. The code below specifies the following DAG:
#
#
# (pre 1)  getData.sh
#              |
#              V
# (job 1)  readData.sub
#            / | \
#   one parallel runs of readData.sh
#            \ | /
#              V
# (job 2)  gene_human.sub
#            / | \
#   ten parallel runs of gene_human.sh
#            \ | /
#              V
# (job 3)  gene_mouse.sub
#            / | \
#   ten parallel runs of gene_mouse.sh
#            \ | /
#              V
# (post 3)  merge.sh
#
#
# Note that "job 1" and "job 2" are each HTCondor job submission
# scripts that will create several distributed jobs that run in
# parallel.
#
# For more information, see
# https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/v8_9_3/users-manual/dagman-applications.html
#
# Run "condor_submit_dag gene.dag" to cause all the code specified in
# the DAG to run in the correct order.
